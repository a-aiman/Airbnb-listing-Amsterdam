# Airbnb-listing-Amsterdam
Airbnb listing for Amsterdam

Used Numpy & Pandas Python libraries for processing (uploading and cleaning) of the Airbnb listing Amsterdam dataset 
in fulfillment of the project (week 1) of CoRise Python for Data Science Certification.

The project is then deployed using Streamlit making an app that visualizes the dataset as a DataFrame and as a geographic visualization
which can be accessed through:
